          The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a self-report inventory
          designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths, and
          preferences. The questionnaire was developed by Isabel Myers and her
          mother Katherine Briggs based on their work with Carl Jung's theory of
          personality types.
