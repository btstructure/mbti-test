      <p>
        The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a self-report inventory
        designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths, and
        preferences. The questionnaire was developed by Isabel Myers and her
        mother Katherine Briggs based on their work with Carl Jung's theory of
        personality types.
